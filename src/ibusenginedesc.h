 * @title: IBusEngineDesc
 * @stability: Stable
 *
 * An IBusEngineDesc stores description data of IBusEngine.
 * The description data can either be passed to ibus_engine_desc_new(),
 * or loaded from an XML node through ibus_engine_desc_new_from_xml_node()
 * to construct IBusEngineDesc.
 *
 * However, the recommended way to load engine description data is
 * using ibus_component_new_from_file() to load a component file,
 * which also includes engine description data.
