 * @stability: Stable
 *
 * An IBusPendingCall is essentially a DBusPendingCall, which representing an expected reply.
 * A IBusPendingCall can be created when you send a message that should have a reply.
 *
 * Besides DBusPendingCall functions, An IBusPendingCall can be manipulated
 * with its own specific functions, which are defined in this section.
